Front End Gulp Boilerplate
==========================

Front-end boilerplate for Gulp with everything you need to get started.

* First download or clone this repo :)
* Then run `sudo npm install` to install dev dependencies. You have to use sudo because some of the dependencies install executable binaries.
* Make sure you install [LiveReload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en) plugin for Google Chrome and enable it (click it so the middle dot is black)

During development mode, run the default task so you'll have watchers and live reload. Simply do the following:
* Run `gulp` to start it up
* Open page from http://localhost:8080 in Chrome
* Try to modify html, scss and javascript files and see how the page gets updated with LiveReload

When you're ready to deploy, simply do the following:
* Run `gulp deploy`
* All of the files you need will be in /dist with your images optimized, css compressed and js compressed

* Fixed SASS crashing on syntax/coding error
* Using default port number now (8080) for web server

February 03, 2014:
* Added caching of images so the deploy feature won't compress the same images multiple times
* Added cleaning of the `dist` folder in case things got deleted at some point
* Made the dev & dist scripts and css compressed file in the same place so no edits to the href/src needs to be done anymore
* Added graceful errors during watch, so SCSS or JS errors no longe break the `watch`

February 25, 2014
* I've been using this more in development and production, so this has been fine tuned a bit
* I added fonts and other misc assets that should be moved from `dev` to `dist` upon deployment
* I removed image caching because there was an issue where it would randomly break all of the images. I'll figure this but out later though.
* Updated npm dependencies accordingly
